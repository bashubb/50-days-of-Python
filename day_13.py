#Basic challange
'''
function called your_vat. The function takes no parameters. 
The function asks the user to input the price of an item and VAT (VAT should be a percentage). 
The function should return the price of the item plus VAT. If the price is 220 and the VAT is 15%, 
your code should return a VAT-inclusive price of 253. Check to see if your code can handle ValueError. 
Ensure the code runs until valid numbers are entered.
